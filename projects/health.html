            <h6>CUSTOMER</h6>
            <p>
                Many platforms exist that already provide home delivery services and what not, we decided to give the consumer more flexibilty and allow him to exercise the choice of home delivery or pick-up from the shop (in case the consumer doesn't want delivery at their doorstep). The user can select from a wide range of products that cater to their medical needs and place an order for the same.

                In addition to online shopping, we added a feature for the user to keep track of their health. This feature allows them to add past health issues such as migraine attacks, stomache ailments etc and how they dealt with it. Once entered, if the user encounters the same medical condition again, they can go through their record and see how they had tackled the situation. Apart from this, doctor visits can be scheduled and past visits are tabulated. Finally, we have added a feature for searching nearby hospitals and pharmacies and displaying the latest medical news.
                
            </p>
            <h6>SHOP KEEPER</h6>
            <p>
                
Once an order is placed, the shop owner can view the order and change the status of the delivery as per the situation. Once he has bagged the item, he can toggle the status to 'Ready for Pick Up' which notifies the user that they can go and collect the item. Once taken, the status is toggled to 'Delivered'.

The shop keeper can change the items on the shelf and update the quantities for various products and modify their availability, price and description.
